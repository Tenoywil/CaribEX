### State Management

- Use Redux Toolkit for global state
- Use Redux-Saga for side effects
- Keep reducers pure
- Use memoized selectors

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Follow existing test patterns

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - Update relevant docs if your change affects them
2. **Add tests** - Include tests for new features or bug fixes
3. **Run quality checks** - Ensure all checks pass:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run format:check
   npm test
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Write clear description** - Explain what, why, and how
5. **Link issues** - Reference related issues using `Fixes #123` or `Relates to #456`

## Issue Guidelines

### Reporting Bugs

Include:

- Clear description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Environment details (OS, Node version, browser)
- Error messages and stack traces

### Suggesting Features

Include:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and benefits
- Proposed implementation (if you have ideas)
- Alternative solutions considered
- Potential drawbacks or concerns

### Issue Labels

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `feature` - New feature request
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `question` - Further information requested

## Architecture Decisions

For significant architectural changes:

1. Open an issue for discussion first
2. Get consensus from maintainers
3. Document the decision in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. Implement the change
5. Update related documentation

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize bundle size
- Optimize images and assets
- Use code splitting where appropriate
- Memoize expensive computations
- Profile before optimizing

## Security

- Never commit sensitive data (keys, passwords, tokens)
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Follow security best practices
- Report security vulnerabilities privately to maintainers

## Questions?

- Check the [documentation](./docs)
- Search existing issues
- Open a new issue with the `question` label
